# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of LEngine** and made some changes to the **initial config file and init file**

LEngine has **much more to offer**!

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://github.com/RealViper8/LEngine/issues/new)

## What's next?

- Modify your `config.lua` with [`configs`](/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-config)
- Add or make custom modules for it?
- Play around.

## Challanges

- Create a snake game using a table.
- Create a simple game of your choice.
